## Current Objective

I am currently seeking machine learning research scientist positions in industry, available in January 2020.   
    
<br />
I focus on machine learning research and applications for social good. My current reasearch focuses on explainability and fairness, especially in complex domains such as graphs. I am also interested in model reduction for on-device and other low-resource environments. My PhD research focused on data science methodologies for inferring and validating graphs constructed from underlying data, with applications in interdisciplinary computational ecology, mobile location privacy, and large-scale multimedia recommendation.
