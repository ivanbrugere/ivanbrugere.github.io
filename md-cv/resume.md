## Current Objective
I am an AI Research Scientist with experience in interdisciplinary biological sciences and spatiotemporal applications. My core interest is in machine learning on graphs/networks. My most recent work has been in fairness and bias, particularly within complex, graph-structured data. My PhD (defended 2020) focused on data science methodologies for inferring and validating graphs derived from underlying data, with applications in social networks, mobile location privacy, and large-scale multimedia recommendation.
